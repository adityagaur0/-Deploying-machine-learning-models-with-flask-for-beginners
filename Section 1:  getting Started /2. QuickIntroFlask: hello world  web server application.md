### 	**1. Import Statements:**
```
from werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response
from flask import Flask
```
### 	**2. Flask App Initialization:**
```
app = Flask(__name__)
```
> You are creating an instance of the Flask class, which represents your web application. The __name__ argument is used to determine the root path of the application.
### 	**3. Route Definition:**
```
@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "helloWorld"
```
> You are defining a route using the @app.route("/") decorator. This means that when a user accesses the root path ("/") of your web application, the hello() function will be executed. The function returns the string "helloWorld," which will be sent as the response to the client.
### 	**4. Run the Application:**
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from werkzeug.serving import run_simple
    run_simple('localhost', 9000, app)
```
> This block checks whether the script is being run directly (__name__ == "__main__") and, if so, it runs the Flask application using the run_simple method from Werkzeug. The application will be accessible at http://localhost:9000/.
The run_simple function takes three arguments:
'localhost': The host on which the application will run.
9000: The port on which the application will listen.
app: The Flask application instance.
This code essentially starts a development server on localhost at port 9000 for testing and development purposes. Note that using run_simple in a production environment is not recommended.
